REPO README - Notes for people checking out of Launchpad (bzr)

-------------------------
Getting duplicity to run:
-------------------------

By the numbers:
1) Do the checkout to a location called $DUP_ROOT:
   [for the dev branch]
   bzr branch lp:duplicity $DUP_ROOT
   or
   [for the stable branch]
   bzr branch lp:~duplicity-team/duplicity/0.6-releases $DUP_ROOT
2) cd $DUP_ROOT/duplicity
3) Run "python compilec.py" to create _librsync.so
4) cd ..
5) Run "PYTHONPATH=$DUP_ROOT bin/duplicity -V". You will see 
   "duplicity $version" instead of the normal version number. 
   Versioning comes during the release.

Use PYTHONPATH to set the path each time that you use the binaries:

PYTHONPATH=$DUP_ROOT bin/duplicity

or

PYTHONPATH=$DUP_ROOT bin/rdiffdir

-----------------------
Running the unit tests:
-----------------------

cd testing; ./run-tests

Please run the tests on your branch before proposing a merge, to ensure that
you have not broken any tests that previously worked.

You can run specific tests using:
tox -- -s [folder].[folder].[file].[class].[test]
For example:
tox -- -s testing.unit.test_selection
or:
tox -- -s testing.unit.test_selection.MatchingTest.test_tuple_include

-----------------------------------------
Testing against multiple Python versions:
-----------------------------------------

Duplicity currently supports Python versions v2.6 or later. Duplicity uses tox
to make it easy to test your code against multiple Python versions. Running
tests using the commands above will automatically test code against
both Python v2.6 and v2.7, if you have both installed on your system.

For instructions on installing Python v2.6 on newer versions of Ubuntu, see
